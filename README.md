# Convert things to GeoJSON.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tmcw/togeojson.png)](https://travis-ci.org/tmcw/togeojson)

This converts [KML](https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/) into
[GeoJSON](http://www.geojson.org/), in a browser or with [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/).

It is

* Dependency-free
* Tiny
* Written in vanilla javascript that's jshint-friendly
* Tested

It is not

* Concerned about ugly extensions to KML
* Concerned with having an 'internal format' of its own


    npm install togeojson

```javascript
// using togeojson in nodejs

var tj = require('togeojson'),
    fs = require('fs'),
    // node doesn't have xml parsing or a dom. use jsdom
    jsdom = require('jsdom').jsdom;

var kml = jsdom(fs.readFileSync('foo.kml', 'utf8'));

var converted = tj.kml(kml);

var converted_with_styles = tj.kml(kml, { styles: true });
```

## KML

Supported:

* Point
* Polygon
* LineString
* name & description
* ExtendedData
* MultiGeometry -> GeometryCollection
* Styles with hashing

Not supported yet:

* Various silly Google extensions (will never be supported)
* NetworkLinks (lol)
* GroundOverlays (lol)

## FAQ

### What is hashing?

KML's style system isn't semantic: a typical document made through official tools
(read Google) has hundreds of identical styles. So, togeojson does its best to
make this into something usable, by taking a quick hash of each style and exposing
`styleUrl` and `styleHash` to users. This lets you work backwards from the awful
representation and build your own styles or derive data based on the classes
chosen.

Implied here is that this does not try to represent all data contained in KML
styles.

### Why isn't this built on OpenLayers

I tried, I tried. But KML relies on XML. Which relies on Classes, Projections,
their absurd OpenLayers.Function and OpenLayers.String classes, which rely
on Vector, and Geometry, and Point. They're all written with apidoc, littered
with trailing spaces, miles away from jshint compliant, and filled with
scope-creep that does nothing for me.

I'm sorry.

### Can it convert back?

No.

### What about flyTo and other Google add-ons?

These will never be supported. These extensions make KML a case example of
[OGC](http://www.opengeospatial.org/)'s failure to make truly cross-compatible
formats - they shouldn't bow to vendors who want to customize formats for
proprietary software within their own, proprietary specifications,
while doing it under the banner of an open specification.
